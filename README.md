# Board Support Package for the Nordic nRF9160-DK

This crate is a Board Support Package (BSP). It wraps the HAL crate
(`nrf9160-hal`) for the on-board nRF9160, and provides high level wrappers for
the onboard features.

## Usage

You will require the `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf` target installed. To build one
of the examples:

```console
$ rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
$ git clone https://github.com/nrf-rs/nrf9160-dk.git
$ cd nrf9160-dk
$ cargo build --target=thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf --example blinky
```

To use in your own application, add as a dependency and call the
`Board::take()` function.
